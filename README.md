Hello! I'm Renata (she/her)👋
[Portfolio](https://www.renata-reinartz.com/) • [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renata1026/) 

I'm a Calgary-based Frontend Web Developer and am attending Juno College of Technology's immersive bootcamp and love learning about ways to 💻 code and solve problems in creative ways.

The majority of my career has been spent in accounting including creating budgets and multicurrency forecasts for multinational companies. As a Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA), I am skilled at problem-solving. In other words, I am capable of coming up with creative solutions when problems arise. In my free time, I enjoy practicing yoga 🧘‍♀️ as a certified yoga teacher. 

📱 Get in touch with me: if you want to discuss transitions in careers, women in technology, yoga, travel etc.

HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React, and firebase

I am looking forward to adding to my tech list over time 🌸!
